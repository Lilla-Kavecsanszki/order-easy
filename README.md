# Accessibility


Accessibility has been a very important point for me while designing the website.

Lighthouse testing for desktop and mobile has scored 100% for accessibility on both.

![Lighthouse Accessibility](readme-images/accessibility-lighthouse-test.png "Lighthouse Accessibility")

I used [A11y](https://color.a11y.com) the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator which determined that no colour contrast issues were found on any of the pages.

## Manual Testing

**Home Page:**

respond correctly and look good on all device widths.

**Let's start link:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the text responds correctly and looks good on all device widths. Click on the link item and verify that it links to the correct part of the page and takes the user to the character buttons to be able to choose one. Hover over the link and verify the hover colour change work as expected. Click on the link item and the audio starts as expected. The speaker icon at the beginning warns the user that the link will have sound.

**Audio control buttons:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the icon buttons display behave and centre as expected and that they look good on all device widths. Hover over the buttons and verify the hover colour change work as expected as well as the zoom-out animation. Click the stop button and the audio stops. Click the play button and the audio carries on from where it was stopped beforehand. If the audio finished, clicking the play button would start over the audio from the beginning.



**? page:**

**Hamburger menu:** Repeat the verification steps done for the navbar on the Home page. Confirm that the hamburger menu code is identical on all HTML pages.

**Instructions:** Go to the "How to play?" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the title and all paragraph texts respond correctly, centre as expected and look good on all device widths. I had to adjust font size and padding-top of the title for this on smaller screen sizes.

Review all functionality and responsiveness on my mobile phone and tablet for all pages.

## User Stories Testing 

1.	As a viewer of the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need, most importantly, to 
    find the quiz efficiently.

    - Regardless of which page the viewer is on, they can easily find and use the navigation bar, it also stays visible and on top of the screen even while scrolling.

    ![Hamburger bar](readme-images/1.userstory.png "Hamburger bar")

2.	As a potential new visitor to the website, I want to understand what the game is about and its rules.

    - By using the sticky navigation menu the user can easily navigate at any time to the "How to play?" page and read the instructions and purpose of the website. 

    ![Instructions](readme-images/2.userstory.png "Instructions")

3.  As a viewer of the website, I want to be able to see my final result and progression in the meantime.

    - After each round, after choosing an answer to the last, tenth question, the user will receive their final points that they achieved with a relevant message along, as well. This information will be displayed in the place of the quiz.
    
    ![Final point and message](readme-images/3a%20userstory.png "Final point and message")

    - With the interactive question counter bar and the score counter on the opposite side, the user can keep track of their journey and success in the game.
    
    ![Display bar](readme-images/3b%20userstory.png "Display bar")

4.  As an interested observer and/or hiring manager, I want to be able to find the web developer and see other projects 
    from her on social media and industry-relevant sites

    - Two website link icons can be found in the footer on every page of the website. One takes the visitor to the web developer’s LinkedIn profile page and the other to her Github profile page.
    
    ![Social media](readme-images/4.%20userstory.png "Social media").

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and browsers and report any issues they find. The height of the logo image was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page and also in media queries respectively. It was covering the let’s start button, the audio control buttons and the Rachel button in the middle of the page, therefore those didn’t work until the issue was resolved.

## Bugs

A few issues came up while testing the website in the meantime; 

1. The encouraging message didn't work properly at some stage. This was an easy fix, as I realised that I was getting the wrong id from the html file, so after this was linked to the correct element.
2. The question counter was going over the number 10, instead of stopping at it and therefore didn't end the quiz properly. When I wanted to start a new round, the game went back to the end of the previous game. I resolved this issue by zeroing down the questionCounter at the end of the game, so it wouldn't overroll anymore. And a new quiz can start each time, also from question 1 again.
3. The questions also didn't restart if I wanted to play a new game with the same character as I previously did. This was resolved by the spread operator (...character.questions). Without this the code was pointing to the questions in the original array and later on with using splice method that was deleting the questions from the original array, therefore we had no questions left. So to restart the game for the same character, the spread operator creates a copy of the original array. 
4. While testing the quiz on mobile-sized screens, The let's start button, audio buttons and the Rachel button didn't work. This issue was resolved by adjusting the height of the logo-image (in media queries) as that was covering the mentioned buttons before.
