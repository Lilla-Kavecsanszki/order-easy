# OrderEasy Application

This application is designed to cater to the needs of all users who work in any environment that involves stocks and their management, especially the ordering part. The primary objective of the app is to simplify and speed up the process of managing stocks for its users. 
The main focus is to be straight forward enough to save time for the user, yet to be engaging and motivating at the same time.

The user can interact with the application in various ways such as viewing the current list of products, adding or removing products with relevant details from the stock list. The app also assists the user in determining how much of each product needs to be ordered based on their input of current stock holding information, which is compared to par levels by the application.

Furthermore, the app stores all stock information and data in an external Google Spreadsheet for easy access and management.

# Features

#### Home - The Menu

The menu is displayed when the application starts to keep the interface simple to use and uncluttered. The menu features five options, functionalities for the user to choose from; 1) Print Product List, 2) Add New Product, 3) Delete Product, 4) Get the Order List and 5) Exit.

![f_menu](readme-images/f_menu.png "f_menu")

The user is prompted to choose one of the menu options by entering the option number. In the event of an invalid input, an error message will be displayed and the main menu will be displayed again.

![Error to menu options](readme-images/invalid_menu_input.png "Error to menu options")

The menu will continue to be displayed repeatedly until the user inputs a valid response and after the completion of each options (1-4). The application will be terminated only when the user selects option 5 from the menu.

#### Option 1 - Print Product List

If the user selects option 1 from the menu they are shown the list of the products that are currently on the stocks sheet in the Google Spreadheet.

This is data taken from the Google Spreadheet, all information listed under each other from its first column. 

![Option1](readme-images/print_product_list.png "Option1")

Products added or deleted while using the application will be reflected on the list when the 'Print Product List' option is subsequently run.

![Updated spreadsheet](readme-images/updated_option_1.png "Updated spreadsheet")

#### Option 2 - Add New Product

The user can add a new product by choosing option 2 from the menu. The application displays a message on screen listing the input requirements and also an example input string of values for better understanding.

![Option2](readme-images/add_new_product.png "Option2")

In the event that the user inputs do not satisfy the validation criteria, they will be prompted to re-enter the required information. The explanation of the data needed is displayed again too. 

The rules for the input values:

- Inputs are separated by commas
- 4 values are required
- The 4th value, the par level, needs to be an integer so that the program can use it for calculations later on

![Invalid input for option2](readme-images/invalid_option2_input.png "Invalid input for option2")

![Invalid literal input for option2](readme-images/integer_error_option2_input.png "Invalid literal input for option2")

When the user inputs valid data the application displays multiple messages to assure the user with information on how the data is being processed and a new row is added to the stocks spreadsheet for the new product. Once the operation is complete it returns to the menu.

![Valid input for option2](readme-images/valid_input_option2.png "Valid input for option2")

The updated Google Spreadsheet:

![Updated Spreadsheet for option2](readme-images/updated_spreadsheet_option2.png "Updated Spreadsheet for option2")

#### Option 3 - Delete Product

The user can remove, delete an already existing product by choosing option 3 from the menu. The application displays a message on screen explaining the input requirement and also an example input string of value for better understanding.

![Option3](readme-images/delete_product.png "Option3")

In the event that the user inputs do not satisfy the validation criteria, they will be prompted to re-enter the required information. The explanation of the data needed is displayed again too. 

The rules for the input values:

- At least 1 string of input is required, not a whitespace
- The product name cannot be left empty

![Invalid input for option3](readme-images/invalid_option3_input.png "Invalid input for option3")

When the user inputs valid data the application displays multiple messages to assure the user with information on how the data is being processed. There are 2 ways where the operation can go; if the program finds a match with the input on the stocks spreadsheet, another message will be dispayed and the first found (matched) item, with its entire row relevantly gets deleted from the stocks spreadsheet for the mentioned product. Always only the first match, in case the user needs the other copy to stay in stocks. Once the operation is complete it returns to the menu.

![Valid input for option3](readme-images/valid_input_option3.png "Valid input for option3")

The updated Google Spreadsheet:

![Updated Spreadsheet for option3](readme-images/updated_spreadsheet_option3.png "Updated Spreadsheet for option3")

When the program doesn't find a match with the input on the stocks spreadsheet, again a message will be dispayed; explaining that the mentioned product is currently not on stock. The product therefore cannot be deleted as does not exist and the program will take the user back to the menu so they can carry on with their work accordingly. 

![Product is not found option3](readme-images/product_is_not_on_stock_option3.png "Product is not found option3")

#### Option 4 - Get the Order List

The main function of the program is when the user can gather relevant information on how much they need to order of their products on stock. They can do this by choosing option 4 from the menu. The application displays a message on screen prompting the user for the first action that they need to do and listing the input requirements, while also providing an example input string of values for better understanding. The program will always ask for the number of data that reflects the current product list on the stocks sheet. This number is calculated by the app by counting the lenght of the first column with values on the stock sheet and then subtracting 1 from it, in order to take the heading row into consideration. 
Therefore this number gets updated each time a new product was added or an existing one was deleted beforehand. 

![Option4](readme-images/get_the_order_list.png "Option4")

In the event that the user inputs do not satisfy the validation criteria, they will be prompted to re-enter the required information. The explanation of the data needed is displayed again too. 

The rules for the input values:

- Inputs are separated by commas
- 'x' values are required, as many values as the program currently requires
- The input values need to be integers or floats so that they reflect stock take method standards and also the program can use them for calculations later on

![Invalid input for option4 by the amount of values](readme-images/invalid_input_option4_bythenumber.png "Invalid input for option4 by the amount of values")

![Invalid input for option4 by their type](readme-images/invalid_input_option4_bythetype.png "Invalid input for option4 by their type")

When the user inputs valid data the application displays multiple messages to assure the user with information on how the data is being processed. First the program updates the stocks sheet with the user inputs and also adds the current date to the heading of the Current Stock Holding column (5th col) so the user can reference it. After that, the application calculates how much the user needs to order of each products. The application calculates this by taking the par level values from the 4th column and from those it subtracts the previously input current stock holding values, 5th column. The results then are uploaded in the stocks spreadsheet, in the 6th column named, How much to order.

![Valid input for option4](readme-images/valid_input_option4.png "Valid input for option4")

The updated Google Spreadsheet:

![Updated Spreadsheet for option4](readme-images/updated_spreadsheet_option4.png "Updated Spreadsheet for option4")

After performing the necessary calculations and updating the stocks sheet with all the required data, the program presents the information to the user in a table format. This makes it easy and quick for the user to read and gather all the necessary information for placing a new order.
Once the operation is complete it returns to the menu.

![Order information](readme-images/order_information.png "Order information")

#### Option 5 - Exit

The user can exit and terminate the application by choosing option 5 from the menu. As a final touch, the program displays a Goodbye message to the user.

![exit](readme-images/exit.png "exit")

## Manual Testing

**Home Page:**

respond correctly and look good on all device widths.

**Let's start link:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the text responds correctly and looks good on all device widths. Click on the link item and verify that it links to the correct part of the page and takes the user to the character buttons to be able to choose one. Hover over the link and verify the hover colour change work as expected. Click on the link item and the audio starts as expected. The speaker icon at the beginning warns the user that the link will have sound.

**Audio control buttons:** Reduce and expand the width of the window to verify that the icon buttons display behave and centre as expected and that they look good on all device widths. Hover over the buttons and verify the hover colour change work as expected as well as the zoom-out animation. Click the stop button and the audio stops. Click the play button and the audio carries on from where it was stopped beforehand. If the audio finished, clicking the play button would start over the audio from the beginning.



**? page:**

**Hamburger menu:** Repeat the verification steps done for the navbar on the Home page. Confirm that the hamburger menu code is identical on all HTML pages.

**Instructions:** Go to the "How to play?" page from a desktop. Reduce and expand the width of the window to confirm that the title and all paragraph texts respond correctly, centre as expected and look good on all device widths. I had to adjust font size and padding-top of the title for this on smaller screen sizes.

Review all functionality and responsiveness on my mobile phone and tablet for all pages.

## User Stories Testing 

1.	As a viewer of the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need, most importantly, to 
    find the quiz efficiently.

    - Regardless of which page the viewer is on, they can easily find and use the navigation bar, it also stays visible and on top of the screen even while scrolling.

    ![Hamburger bar](readme-images/1.userstory.png "Hamburger bar")

2.	As a potential new visitor to the website, I want to understand what the game is about and its rules.

    - By using the sticky navigation menu the user can easily navigate at any time to the "How to play?" page and read the instructions and purpose of the website. 

    ![Instructions](readme-images/2.userstory.png "Instructions")

3.  As a viewer of the website, I want to be able to see my final result and progression in the meantime.

    - After each round, after choosing an answer to the last, tenth question, the user will receive their final points that they achieved with a relevant message along, as well. This information will be displayed in the place of the quiz.
    
    ![Final point and message](readme-images/3a%20userstory.png "Final point and message")

    - With the interactive question counter bar and the score counter on the opposite side, the user can keep track of their journey and success in the game.
    
    ![Display bar](readme-images/3b%20userstory.png "Display bar")

4.  As an interested observer and/or hiring manager, I want to be able to find the web developer and see other projects 
    from her on social media and industry-relevant sites

    - Two website link icons can be found in the footer on every page of the website. One takes the visitor to the web developer’s LinkedIn profile page and the other to her Github profile page.
    
    ![Social media](readme-images/4.%20userstory.png "Social media").  

[Back to top](https://github.com/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/order-easy#contents)

## Further testing

I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and browsers and report any issues they find. The height of the logo image was adjusted as a result of this on the Home page and also in media queries respectively. It was covering the let’s start button, the audio control buttons and the Rachel button in the middle of the page, therefore those didn’t work until the issue was resolved.

[Back to top](https://github.com/Lilla-Kavecsanszki/order-easy#contents)

## Bugs

A few issues came up while testing the website in the meantime; 

1. The encouraging message didn't work properly at some stage. This was an easy fix, as I realised that I was getting the wrong id from the html file, so after this was linked to the correct element.
